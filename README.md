# Behavioral_Cloning_P3
Trains a car on a simulator to drive around a test track without crashing.

  Drive.py controls the driving simulator. This can be used with a mouse and keyboard, but it works far better with a joystick. The joystick allows for smoother turns which is important for training the model.
  The training code is in model.py.ipynb.
